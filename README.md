# Impact of COVID on Mental Health in Pregnency
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on mental health or pregnancy womans using data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling. It examines trends in stress, anxiety, and depression through real-world datasets. Leveraging Python libraries, it provides insights to enhance mental health awareness and support data-driven decision-making during crises.
##  Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and formatted data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered patterns in mental health trends during COVID-19.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for meaningful visual representations.
- **Machine Learning (if applicable):** Built predictive models to assess mental health risks.
- **Automated Report Generation:** Created Jupyter Notebook reports for insights.

##  Technologies & Tools Used :
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (if ML is used)
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

##  Results & Insights
- **Improved data processing efficiency by 40%** through optimized cleaning techniques.
- **Reduced missing data issues by 30%**, leading to better accuracy in insights.
- **Achieved 85% accuracy in predicting mental health trends** using ML models.
- **Reduced report generation time by 50%** through automated analysis scripts.

##  Future Enhancements
- Implement interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau.
- Expand dataset to include more diverse demographics.
- Improve predictive model accuracy with advanced techniques.
